# The HLMWadEditor
The Wad Editor is an overhauled and feature complete version of the Explorer. Instead of only given the option of replacing assets, the Editor provides a suite of tools for previewing and modifying every aspect of Hotline Miami 2. No more searching entire texture pages for that last frame of Corey's walk sprite.

The Editor borrows a lot of concepts and design from the Explorer, so modders of old can take advantage of the familiarity without the restrictions of the Explorer.
