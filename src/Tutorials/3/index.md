## Resizing an Animation

Modifying our magnum sprite was pretty simple. We extracted the sprite, changed it to whatever size we wanted, made it look however we wanted. Then imported the sprite, not touching any of the settings, and we were good to go. Animations are where things start to get tricky.

We want to enlarge our players walking animation, in this case `sprSonWalkMagnum` in `Atlases/Player_Son.meta`, to fit our long magnum. 16 pixels width-wise to be exact.
