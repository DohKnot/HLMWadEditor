A tool that lets the user replace the games textures and sounds with their own. This opened the door for custom level creators and modders to make whatever they wanted. We could finally put John Wick in Hotline Miami. The Explorer used in combination with custom campaigns, and some creative problem avoiding, you could create your own game. There was just one small catch. You couldn't resize textures or sprites. If you wanted to reskin the magnum revolver sprite, with a measily sprite size of 10 by 15 pixels, to be a huge ass-railing railgun that would definitely be bigger that 10x15, you simply could not. The Explorer could only let you replace assets, not deeply modify them. And for a long time, modding was essentially just replacing texture pages. We knew the gatekeepers were a couple of binary files that contained sprite metadata. But more roadblocks were in the way. These binary files were encoded in a custom format only known to the developers and only readable by the game. We tried to get in contact with the developers but they informed us that they didn't have the details \"readily available\" and reported me to U.S. officials, thanks jonatan I'm now serving 54 years for \"Thick Skin\" and several accounts of manslaughter. So we were left with nothing but a hex editor to crack the files. In mid 2021 the file format was finally cracked by yours truly and now the floodgates were unlocked.

Get your tools! If you're new to this install the wad Explorer and later the Editor . They are the core utilites that let you mod Hotline Miami. Shoutouts to muster128 for the patched version that kickstarted the Editor project. If nothing comes up when you launch, switch the base wad to the hlm2_data_desktop.wad file in the games installed directory Core Concepts This section goes over the types of game files we are free to manipulate. Game Resources When you view the base wad file archive's (the hlm2_data_desktop.wad file located in the games installed directory) contents you will see a few different kinds of data a few key ones are: The Atlases/ folder has all of the games sprite graphics. In here are .png texture pages with a .meta sprite atlas file of the same name. The .meta files are just a big cookie cutter for the sprites on the texture page. The Fonts/ folder has the fonts used throughout the game. Just like the Atlases/ folder you have a .png character page followed by an .fnt (xml formatted) atlas. The Sounds/ folder has every sound in the game. Sounds must be in a .wav format. Music For level music, switch to the hlm2_music_desktop.wad file located next to the base wad. Hotline Miami modding begins with the base hlm2_data_desktop.wad . This .wad file is an uncompressed file archive storing all of Hotline Miami's resources. It holds every texture, shader, sound, font, sprite, tile, level, object, and dialogue line in the game! This is the file that the Explorer and Editor should reference when making modifications. Mods All Hotline Miami mods are saved as .patchwad files. Fun fact, Patchwads are literally just a WAD Archives with the word \"patch\" thrown in the file extension. The key difference is that instead of storing all of the games assets it only contains the modified duplicates of the originals, a patch. Most mods need to be loaded at game launch and will need to be placed and located in your users Documents/My Games/HotlineMiami2/Mods folder. If you've downloaded a level from the Steam Workshop you might be able to find a patchwad in a special little folder called mods in said levels workshop content folder. The Editor For Downloads the Github's releases page has up to date versions. The Editor is like if the Explorer did cocaine and got dark mode. It borrows a lot of concepts and design from the Exlporer, so modders of old can take advantage of the familiarity, but does so much more. It allows you achieve what was previously thought impossible. Mod Compatability Mods made with the HLMWadEditor will not be compatable with any other mod and will cause many unintended side effects Initial Setup Like the Explorer, the Editor nees a base wad to reference. To do so is the same as the Editor, File/Switch base wad and locate your base wad.","title":"0.
